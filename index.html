    <h2> The introduction of the Artificial intelligence </h2>
    Artificial intelligence is one of the branches of computer science in the current era.
    And the term artificial intelligence - referred to by the abbreviation (AI) - can be defined as the ability of digital machines and computers to perform certain tasks that simulate
    and resemble those performed by intelligent objects; Such as the ability to think or learn from previous experiences or other processes that require mental processes.
    And artificial intelligence aims to reach systems that have intelligence and behave in the way that humans act in terms of learning and understanding,
    so that these systems provide their users with various services of education and guidance interaction and so on.
